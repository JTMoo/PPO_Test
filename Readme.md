# Deep reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that is used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to make decisions based on trial and error.
In reinforcement learning, the AI agent interacts with an environment and learns from the feedback it receives in the form of rewards or punishments.

# PPO
PPO stands for Proximal Policy Optimization, which is a deep reinforcement learning algorithm used for training artificial intelligence (AI) agents. 
It is a model-free, on-policy algorithm that is designed to optimize the policy of the agent in a way that maximizes the expected reward.
